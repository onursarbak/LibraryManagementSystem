# LibraryManagementSystem
Developing a project that allows adding, removing and searching books in the library system

In this project you will be building “Library Management System” using object-oriented programming techniques. This program will use books.txt file that you will create as a database where each line will represent a single book. At each line, book name, author, release date and number of pages will be kept and separated with a comma.

1. Create a class named “Library”: 

2. Add the following methods to library:
   
  a. List Books: This method will list all the books in the books.txt file.     
   
  b. Add Book: This method will add a book to a books.txt file.   
  
  c. Remove Book: This method will delete the book with the given title from the books.txt. 

  d. Search Book: This method allows you to search the library for a book and add a book if it is not available

  e. Search Author: This method allows you to search for authors and lists the books in the library belonging to those authors
   
3. Create an object named “lib” with “Library” class.
   
4. Create a menu to interact with the “lib” object.
